            <h2>Hello there!</h2><p>I'm Bridget, a MLIS student in her final semester hoping to work in academia. My undergraduate background is in modern languages and creative writing, and I would love to continue on with a PhD after my master's. In addition to English, I speak French, Spanish, and some Russian.</p>
	<p>One of my favorite things to do is travel. I had the privilege of living in France the year after I finished undergrad, and I loved the experience. I'm very excited to be going to Finland in May!</p>
	<p>I will, however, be very sad to leave my cat behind on the trip. His name is Sir Lancelot, and he's incredibly clingy. </p>
